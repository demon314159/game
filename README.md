Arcade Baseball


  There are two ways to experience this game:

  'arcade-baseball' launches a Perspective View in Landscape format

  'arcade-baseball 1' launches a Top View in Portrait format


  Left mouse button or left shift key pitches the Ball

  Right mouse button or right shift key activates the Bat

  Game Over after three Outs

  (Hitting all targets will cancel an Out)

  The N key will start a new game

To build this program:

This is a Qt6 application so run `qmake6 arcade-baseball.pro` to generate the Makefile, then run `make`

Or open the project file 'arcade-baseball.pro' in qtcreator
